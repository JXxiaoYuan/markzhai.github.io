Hello, I am markzhai, a developer with passion for learning technology and putting into practice all my life.

Recently I put emphasis on Java, Android and JavaScript. Previously, I had experiences in Web Server, Hadoop, HBase, Redis, C++, Data Mining, Cryptography, etc.

BTW, though Mac is convenient for development, I am still a Windows fan, lol.

You can know me though my [GitHub](https://github.com/markzhai) or Email(zhaiyifan56@gmail.com).

For Chinese friends, you can reach me at [sina weibo](http://weibo.com/zhayaofen).
